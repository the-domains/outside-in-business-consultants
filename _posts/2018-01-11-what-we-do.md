## What We Do

Outside In Business Consultants is a management consulting group providing business leaders with simple yet powerful tools to help your business run more smoothly and more profitably.

If you know you need to focus on the "Big Picture" but can't seem to carve out the time, if you are looking to establish clear, actionable steps to meet your goals this year and into the future, you are not alone. Explore these pages and see if we've struck a chord with you. Our business is, simply put, to help you succeed!

Our strategic planning system was founded in 1990 and has proven effective with hundreds of clients. Many clients return for updated plans periodically.

Over 80% of start-up businesses fail within their first five years. Our process of strategic planning, business planning, and development of the organizational structures has dramatically increased the success rate of businesses using these processes.
